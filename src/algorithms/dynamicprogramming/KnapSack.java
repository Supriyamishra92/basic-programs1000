 * Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we need to find a subset of
 * these items which will give us maximum profit such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number ‘C’.
 * Each item can only be selected once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or we skip it.
 * Items: { Apple, Orange, Banana, Melon }
 * Weights: { 2, 3, 1, 4 }
 * Profits: { 4, 5, 3, 7 }
 * Knapsack capacity: 5
