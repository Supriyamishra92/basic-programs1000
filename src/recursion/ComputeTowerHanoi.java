/***
 Problem Statement :
 Write a program which prints a sequence of operations that transfers n rings from one peg to another.
 You have a third peg, which is initially empty.
 The only operation you can perform is taking a single ring from the top of one peg
 and placing it on the top of another peg. You must never place a larger ring above a smaller ring.

**/

/***
 *
 * ALGORITHM :
 *
 * TOTAL MOVES REQUIRED : For n disks, total 2n â€“ 1 moves are required.
 * For n disks, total 2^n -1 function calls are made. for n = 4, 2^
 * To transfer four rings,
 * move the top three rings to the third peg,
 * then moving the lowest ring (which is the largest) to the second peg,
 * and then transfer the three rings on the third peg to the second peg,
 * using the first peg as an intermediary.
 * For both the three ring and four ring transfers,
 * the first and third steps are instances of the same problem, which suggests the use of recursion.
